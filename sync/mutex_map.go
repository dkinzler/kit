// MutexMap allows to obtain a mutex lock that is scoped to a given string key.
// I.e. only one goroutine at a time can hold the lock for the same key, while locks for different keys are independent.
//
// An example use case might be a HTTP service that processes requests concurrently, but we want to make sure that at most one request for the same user is handled at a time.
// To achieve this, one can share a single MutexMap across all http handler goroutines and the http handler obtains the lock for the user (by e.g. using a userId as the key for the MutexMap)
// before doing any work.
//
// Example usage:
//
//	mm := NewMutexMap()
//	l := mm.Lock("exampleKey")
//	// prefer to call Unlock() with defer right after locking, to make sure the lock gets unlocked eventually
//	defer l.Unlock()
//
// Careful: nested locks, i.e. trying to obtain a lock for key x while already holding the lock for key y, can lead to deadlocks.
//
